Use conding conventions similar (not equal) to Adobe's:

* constants: upper case with underscore: THIS_IS_A_CONSTANT
    
* functions: all lower case with underscore: this_is_a_function()

* types (structs, classes): all lower case with underscores and _t suffix

* pointer types (whether actual pointers or C++11 ptrs): _ptr_t

* private data members: all lower case with underscores and _ suffix

* public data members (structs with no methods only): same as regular variables

* enum: enums are types and therefore the enum type name follows the same
  convention as the the type names (_t)

* enum values: same as functions ? aren't those constant ? should I use
  capitals ?

* indentation: 4 spaces

* template parameters: CamelCase + 'T'

* macros: same as constants

* globals: _g

* space: assignment, operators, template brackets

* one parameter per line in function calls when calls doesn't fit in one line

* 80 columns

* fine names: same as function declaration

* one declaration per line
